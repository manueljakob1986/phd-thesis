Ph.D. dissertation "Parking policies and their impact on urban networks" by Manuel Jakob, ETH Zürich, October 2020

The data used to support the findings of my Ph.D. dissertation is available here. The frameworks are implemented with the aid of a simple numerical solver such as Matlab. That data includes the time stamps of all cars arriving to the area, and the times they leave the area after parking, as well as the parking occupancy in the area at the start of our simulation.
